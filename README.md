### Intro to the VERY basics of programming

Programming is all about typing up information (code) and then sending it through a compiler, which will then generate a .exe file, which means that you can take that .exe and use it whenever you would like.  

##### Basic Vocab

**Code**- The information that you type up in a program of your choice that will be used to make the .exe  
**Variables**- Ok, these are kinda hard to explain to newbs, but here's a semi-visual that should help: Ok, picture a hollow box, with the top cut off. Now, imagine sticking something in there that you want to be able to take out and look at and change a lot, and then closing it. That is essentially what a variable is: A bit of stored information (whether it be a number, string, or anything else).  
**Strings**- Strings are technically sentences, every bit of text you see typed here is a string. Strings can be anything from numbers to letters.  
**Compiler**- Compilers are the programs that you use to "compile" your finished code in to an exe file so you can use it. Microsoft Visual Studio is a very good example.  
**Input**- Input is an essential part of programming. Input involves the user typing something into the keyboard, moving their mouse/joystick, or even talking in to a microphone. All input is used in some way and generally results in some sort of output.  
**Output**- Output is anything that affects your senses. Your moniter is the main source of output, and the speakers also.  
**Header Files**- Header files are any files with a .h at the end. All header files allow you to use more and more commands in your program. Why not just use all of the header files in one program? Well, I've thought of that, and the biggest reason why you wouldn't want to do that is because it would take up A LOT OF SPACE. Just all of the included header files with MSVS is over 1000 files with almost 30 megs of space in total, and that's A LOT OF SPACE considering they are basically text files.

That should be all of the basic info you need to know, but otherwise, just email me (ragingflame@msn.com) and I'll add it to this tutorial.
